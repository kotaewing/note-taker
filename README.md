## Description
This website was designed with the busiest people in mind.  This is a note taking app, a way for you to keep track of To-Do's or any other note your heart desires!  Simply press the pencil icon and give your note a title and then write whatever your heart desires.

## Usage
To use the website, click the pencil icon in the upper right hand corner of the page.  One you are on the new note, type a title into the Title section, and your note into the Body section.  When you are finished, click the save icon and your note will pop up on the left hand column with all of your other notes. If you would like to view a previous note, click on the note in the left column and it will populate in the main field for you to read.  While there is a delete icon, delete functionality has not yet been added, but will be in the future!
